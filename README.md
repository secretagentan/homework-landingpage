#FEWD Week #2: Styling with CSS

This assignment is geared to challenge you to create a **single-column** landing page and apply more advanced CSS techniques to it.  

**A crucial component of this assignment is to practice building based off of an existing design!** 

You have some options for this assignment, but in both cases, you are asked to use the included *design_file.txt*:

- We are including an example mockup as one option for you to build from

- You may also sketch your own **single-column** page and build that

  If you go this route though, please

  - be aware that you will be building off of the site you create for the next couple of assignments
  - include a picture/copy of your mockup/wireframe/sketch with your submission 
  - adhere to the *design_file.txt* by styling the corresponding element in your own page..for example, style your "logo/primary heading" instead of "Relaxr" as it is described

### If you choose to use the sample mockup/site, here is some background...

####Description


A hot, new NY Tech Startup, Relaxr, has approached you to help them develop a new landing page for their company. They've handed you the [design file](starter_code/design_file.txt) for the site, along with the copy and assets. You need to take these files and turn it into a landing page.
